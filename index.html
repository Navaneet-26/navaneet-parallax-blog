            DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the study of organizing data
            efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees,
            paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve
            problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and
            accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.
            <br />
            Why to Learn DSA? Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities
            and make you a stronger programmer. DSA is foundation for almost
            every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps,
            Databases, Web Applications, etc Top Companies like Google,
            Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA
            in interviews.

            HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language .It is the standard
            markup language for creating web pages.<br> CSS: CSS stands for
            Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout web pages,
            including the design, colors, and fonts.<br> JavaScript: JavaScript is a
            programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is an
            essential part of web applications and is used to create dynamic
            content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
            <br>Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for developing
            responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides pre-designed
            components and styles to speed up the development process.<br> React:
            React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It
            allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the

            Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used
            interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two.
            Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all
            sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is
            actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a
            sub-field of neural networks. The way in which deep learning and
            machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep"
            machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised
            learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily
            require a labeled dataset. The deep learning process can ingest
            unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can
            automatically determine the set of features which distinguish
            different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some
            of the human intervention required and enables the use of large
            amounts of data. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine
            learning" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture1.
